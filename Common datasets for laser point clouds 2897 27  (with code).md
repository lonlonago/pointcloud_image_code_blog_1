#  Princeton ModelNet (CAD files) 

 The goal of the Princeton ModelNet project is to provide researchers in computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, and cognitive science with comprehensive 3D CAD models of objects.

#  Princeton Shape 

 The dataset contains a database of 3D polygon models collected from the World Wide Web. For each 3D model, an Object File Format (.off) file with the polygon geometry of the model, a model information file (e.g., the location from which it came), and a JPEG image file with a thumbnail view, the model. Benchmark Version 1 contains 1,814 models. 

 It also provides a library of software tools corresponding to the datasets for processing these datasets.

  In addition, it also provides methods for converting PLY data format files to other formats: 

>  Our utility for converting PLY files to Inventor files. Click here to download the executable.Richard Harding of the Sony Playstation group has contributed a ply-to-Maya plugin. It supports import from PLY to Maya, and export from Maya to PLY, for versions 6.0 and 7.0 of Maya. Starting with Maya 8.5, this exporter can be downloaded from http://sites.google.com/site/mayaplyimportexport/.Bruce Merry of South Africa has written a script to import PLY files to Blender. Click here to download it.A shareware program written by Zoltan Karpati for converting between many 3D formats, including PLY.For converting PLY to OBJ/3DS formats, there used to be a free demo version of Deep Exploration, available here, but we hear it is no longer available.Diego Nehab (Princeton) has also written a toolkit for manipulating PLY files.Another site with information about PLY files is the PLY File Format page of the Georgia Institute of Technology's Large Geometric Models Archive.Jo�o Oliveira of University College London has modified the Georgia Tech libraries so that reading of PLY files is robust to the line breaks inserted when editing them on various platforms. Here is his package.Okino's PolyTrans package includes a PLY importer and exporter.Paolo Cignoni's MeshLab system, available from SourceForge.A C++ library for parsing PLY files, written by Ares Lagae, is available here.

 The purpose of this website is to provide large models for researchers in computer graphics and related fields. There are thousands of geometric models available online, but the vast majority are small and therefore do not provide adequate challenges for creators of new geometric algorithms and techniques. Very large models are a challenge for techniques of rendering, auto-simplification, geometric compression, visibility techniques, surface reconstruction and surface fitting. In the digital age, there are many sources of very large geometric datasets, but many researchers do not have access to this data. This website attempts to rectify this situation.
