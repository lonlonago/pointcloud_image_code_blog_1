CloudCompare supports multi-window linkage to display multiple point cloud data, which can be used to compare the original point cloud data with the semantic segmentation results.

 After opening CloudCompare, there will be a default view. If we want to open two data at the same time, we need to create another view. Select 3D Views in the menu bar and click New in the drop-down menu, thus creating a new view. At this time, there are two views, 3D View 1 and 3D View 2, in the drop-down menu of 3D Views, and then click Title in the 3D Views drop-down menu. At this time, two parallel windows will appear in the data display area.

 Drag the data into the two windows respectively. Generally, the initialization state of the two windows is the same, as shown in the following figure

 If you accidentally drag and scale one of the data before doing the linkage, the initialization state of the two data is inconsistent, as shown below

 You can reset the initialization state of the point cloud data through Camera settings in the Display menu. First, adjust the scale of the two views through the mouse wheel. As shown in the figure below, then open the Camera settings panel, adjust X1, Y1, and Z1 in Current mode to 0, and do the same for both windows (click the mouse directly to select the window), and then you can see that the two data states are exactly the same.  

#  Three, two windows linkage 

 Select the Camera link in the Display drop-down menu to link the two data, drag any data, and the other data will move with it, so that you can compare the two data.
